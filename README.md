# **the odin recipe website**

**[This](https://kojokwakye.github.io/odin-recipes/)** is what i submitted to the https://www.theodinproject.com/ food assignment


## personal assesment
---

- the **[main](https://kojokwakye.github.io/odin-recipes/)** page.

    it contains  a list of three recipes and an header which were centered using flex-box.

- every one of the sub-pages have the same basic styling. 
- there is a footer beneath every one of the sub-pages to direct you through the website


### notes
---
- absolute and relative links will whip your ass if you dont pay attention
