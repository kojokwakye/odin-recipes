## personal assesment

- *[Homepage](https://kojokwakye.github.io/odin-recipes/)*

    page contains  a list of three recipes and an header
    everthing is centered using flex-box

- every one of the sub-pages have the same basic styling. 
- there is a footer beneath every one of the sub-pages that directs you through the assignment


### notes

- absolute and relative links will whip your ass if you dont pay attention
